The stack restricts access to its entries. A client can look at or remove only the top
entry. The only way to look at an entry that is not at the top of the stack is to
repeatedly remove items from the stack until the desired item reaches the top. If you
were to remove all of a stackâ€™s entries, one by one, you would get them in reverse
chronological order, beginning with the most recent and ending with the first item
added to the stack.

5.2 The operation that adds an entry to a stack is traditionally called push . The remove
operation is pop . The operation that retrieves the top entry without removing it is
named peek . Typically, you cannot search a stack! for a particular entry. The
following specifications define a set of operations for the ADT stack.

1. However, the Java Class Library has a class of stacks that does define a search method, as you will see later in this
chapter.
