# rust-word-counter
The simple project reads in a text file, finds only alpha-numeric characters, then iterates over the reamining text via a loop. 
I then use a hashmap to keep track of word occurances, until finally it is printed to the console the amount of times each word occured.

In this project, I learned a lot about hashmaps in Rust, how varaible mutability works, and how concise you are able to make Rust code
if you continue to pick at it.
